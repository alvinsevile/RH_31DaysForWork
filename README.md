# FiveM 31 Days of Work - ESX/QBCore Compatible

This resource for FiveM allows the implementation of temporary jobs on the server, compatible with ESX and QBCore frameworks. Players can purchase a specific job for a limited time, and once that time has elapsed, they are reassigned as unemployed.

# Features

- Compatibility with ESX and QBCore
- Assigns jobs to players for a limited time.
- The assigned job is automatically removed when the time expires.
- Easily configure the job name, duration, price, and map coordinates.
- Receive notifications both when receiving and losing the job.

# Requirements

- es_extended or qb-core

# Installation

- Download or clone this repository into your FiveM resources folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/RHScripts/RH_31DaysForWork.git
```

- Add the resource to your `server.cfg` file:

```
ensure RH_31DaysForWork
```

- Configure the `config.lua` file according to your preferences.

# Configuration

The `config.lua` file includes several options to customize the behavior of the temporary job system:

```
Config = {}

Config.Framework = 'esx' -- Or 'qbcore'

-- Marker Configuration
-- MARKERS: https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/markers/
Config.MarkerPos = vector3(100.0, -1000.0, 28.0) -- Change coordinates as needed
Config.MarkerSize = vector3(1.5, 1.5, 1.5) -- Change marker size as needed
Config.MarkerColor = {r = 0, g = 255, b = 0, a = 100} -- Change marker color as needed
Config.MarkerType = 1  -- Change marker type as needed

-- Blip Configuration
-- BLIPS: https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/blips/
Config.Blip = {
    Pos = vector3(100.0, -1000.0, 28.0),
    Sprite = 280,
    Display = 4,
    Scale = 1.0,
    Colour = 2,
    Name = "Taxi Job"
}

-- Job Configuration
Config.JobName = 'taxi'
Config.JobDuration = 31 -- In real days / client.lua line 43
Config.JobPrice = 150000 -- Price to acquire the job

```

# Explicaci√≥n de las opciones:

- Framework: Select between esx or qbcore depending on your server.
- MarkerPos: Coordinates where the marker will appear for players to purchase the job.
- Blip: Configures the appearance and name of the blip on the map.
- JobName: Name of the job that will be assigned to players.
- JobDuration: Duration of the temporary job in days.
- JobPrice: Price that players must pay to acquire the job.

# How It Works

- Players can purchase a temporary job (e.g., Taxi Job) by interacting with a marker on the map.
- The job lasts for a specified period (Configured as 31 days, with an example of 1 minute).
- When the time expires, the player loses the job and is reassigned as unemployed.

# Events and Notifications

- Automatic notifications inform the player when they receive and lose the job.

# Notifications:
- ESX: 
```
TriggerClientEvent('esx:showNotification', ...)
```
- QBCore: 
```
TriggerClientEvent('QBCore:Notify', ...)
```

# Job Purchase Event:

- Players can purchase the job using the event job:purchaseJob.


# Future Modifications
- Add more temporary jobs.
- Improvements in customization.
